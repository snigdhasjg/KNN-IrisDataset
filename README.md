# K Nearest Neighbor
KNN falls in the supervised learning family of algorithms. Informally, this means that we are given a labelled dataset consiting of training observations (x,y) and would like to capture the relationship between x and y. More formally, our goal is to learn a function h:Xâ†’Y so that given an unseen observation x, h(x) can confidently predict the corresponding output y.
We are using KNN as classification predictive problems.
